## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:t







- [ ] The file Introductions.txt should be changed from an Introduction to Mela to an Introduction to yourself. Make sure you have pushed your local changes to your GitHub repo

- [ ] There should be a file called thingsIlike.txt containing a list of things you like.


- [ ] Your folder for Practical 3 shuold contain a file called Reflection.txt with a short reflection on how the practical went, what you learned and what you found difficult


-   [ ] Commit messages should contain information about what changes were made in the most recent commit. A message such as “all tasks” is not a helpful commit message




### Feedback Week 4:




- [ ] The second part of the variables.py exercise is missing: It should define Booleans X, Y, Z, and W, as laid out in the practical instructions.



- [ ] In file  collatz.py, pseudocode should be use to explain and document your code.





- [ ] In the "powers of 2" exercise, pseudocode should be used to explain and document your code.
- [ ]  The powers of 2 exercise is mathematically correct, but would be better if the answer did not have a "+" at the end. 




### Feedback Week 5:

The code for week 5 is great. There is no need to change anything. 






This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade.
